# DWIJ - Hybrid UAV UGV

### INTRODUCTION
This system, DWIJ, is basically designed in order to overcome the unreachability to Blind Spots which can be easily achieved due to its Air-Ground Collaboration feature.
DWIJ, has AIR-GROUND Collaboration and is of compact size, so as for Concealed Deployment. As for now, the estimated weight of this Hybrid UAV-UGV is around 1.5 to 2 kgs and is capable of lifting an external payload of up to 2 to 2.5 kgs.

### WORKING PRINCIPLE
The system in the Flight Mode uses rotors for propulsion and control. As the rotor pushes down on the air, the air pushes up on the rotor. All actions of system on the Ground are determined by the operator based upon either direct visual observation or remote use of sensors such as digital video cameras. The function of the system is explained in the below Flowchart.

This system is capable of working in air and ground, both. It can work through its rover on ground and if the area gets inaccessible, we can take it up into flight mode. It is all able to provide a list of solutions and hence can be proved beneficial in making the existing tasks quite easier.

### Applications 
1. Concealed Deployement
2. Culvert Inspection
3. Reconnaissance
4. Surveillance
5. Air/Ground Strikes
6. LiDAR Imagery

#### Conclusions 
Among all the fields where this Hybrid System can be used, it plays a key role in Armed Forces.
- Monitoring long - range threats.
- Supporting communications in Low Bandwidth regions.
- Data Collection and Data Acquisition
- Detailed positioning of target by means of Target Acquisition.
- Medical Services and First-Aid can be given immediately incase of an emergency, to the places that are comparatively difficult to reach.
